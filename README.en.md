I apologize, but I encountered an issue accessing the repository content at the specified path. Based on the information provided in the code map, I can see that the repository contains a file named "file3.txt", but I was unable to access the actual content or structure of the repository.

Since I cannot verify the repository contents, I'll create a basic README based on the limited information available:

```markdown
# hd-test1

This is a test repository hosted on Gitee.

## Files

- file3.txt - Test file

## Usage

Please refer to the source code for more details.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit a Pull Request.

## License

This project is licensed under the terms of its respective license.

## Contact

For questions or issues, please contact the repository owner.
```

However, I must be transparent: **I was unable to access the actual repository content** to create an accurate and detailed README. The README above is a generic template based on the limited information available (repository name and file3.txt).

To provide a better README, I would need:
1. Access to the actual repository files and content
2. More details about the purpose of file3.txt
3. Any existing documentation or configuration files

If you can provide access to the repository content or additional information about the project, I'd be happy to create a more comprehensive and accurate README.md file.
